1--> get the array elements

2--> 
  make the first element i=0
  make the second element j=i+1
  
  start from 0 go until arr.length-2
   give the arr[i] to min
   give the i to pos
  repeat following statement until j becomes out of bound
  {
  if arr[j]<min
  {
  then min=arr[j]
  then 
  j=j+1
  }
  swap arr[i] and arr[pos]
  then 
  i=i+1,j=i+1
  }
